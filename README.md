lua-sass
========

[Lua] bindings for [libsass].

Status
------

**Unmaintained**.

The upstream [libsass] library was [declared deprecated] on 27th
October 2020:

> Warning: LibSass is deprecated. While it will continue to receive
> maintenance releases indefinitely, there are no plans to add additional
> features or compatibility with any new CSS or Sass features.

This would effectively mean that lua-sass is also deprecated, but in
addition to that, since I no longer have any need for (or interest in)
Sass, I now consider lua-sass to be entirely unmaintained.
